    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <div class="updated">Last updated: 18 January 2026</div>

    <p>
      This Privacy Policy describes how <strong>LiteralAF</strong> ("we", "our", or "us")
      collects, uses, and protects your information when you use the LiteralAF mobile
      application (the "App").
    </p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

    <h3>1.1 Information You Provide</h3>
    <p>
      LiteralAF does not require account creation to use the core features of the App.
      We do not collect personally identifiable information such as your name, email
      address, phone number, or contacts.
    </p>

    <h3>1.2 Automatically Collected Information</h3>
    <p>
      When you use the App, certain non-personal information may be collected automatically,
      including:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Device type, operating system, and app version</li>
      <li>Anonymous usage data (e.g., game progress, scores, feature interactions)</li>
      <li>Crash logs and performance diagnostics</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This information is used solely to improve app stability, gameplay experience,
      and performance.
    </p>

    <h3>1.3 Advertising Data</h3>
    <p>
      LiteralAF may display ads using third-party advertising networks.
      These networks may collect anonymous identifiers (such as Advertising ID)
      to provide relevant ads and measure ad performance.
    </p>
    <p>
      We do not have access to, nor control over, how third-party advertisers
      collect or use your data.
    </p>

    <h2>2. How We Use Information</h2>
    <p>
      We use the collected information to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Operate and improve the App</li>
      <li>Analyze gameplay and usage trends</li>
      <li>Fix bugs and improve performance</li>
      <li>Display ads and measure their effectiveness</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>
      We do not sell, trade, or rent your personal information.
      Anonymous and aggregated data may be shared with trusted third-party services
      strictly for analytics, crash reporting, or advertising purposes.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
    <p>
      We take reasonable measures to protect your information against unauthorized access,
      alteration, disclosure, or destruction. However, no method of transmission over

    <h2>5. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      LiteralAF is intended for a general audience. We do not knowingly collect personal
      information from children under the age of 13. If you believe that a child has
      provided personal information through the App, please contact us so we can take
      appropriate action.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
      The App may contain links to or use third-party services (such as ad providers
      or analytics tools). We are not responsible for the privacy practices of these
      third parties. We encourage you to review their respective privacy policies.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected
      on this page with an updated "Last updated" date. Continued use of the App after
      changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.
